# Hash Tables

- Hash tables are a data structure that takes key-value pairs, they exist and implemented in many languages
- Hash tables store data in a large array and work by hashing the keys to get an array index
- a good hash function is fast, deterministic, and distributes keys uniformaly
- Hash tables can find a value quickly given a key
- Hash tables can insert new key-value pair quickly
- to deal with keys that are hashed to the same index, we use strategies like seperate chaining or linear probing
