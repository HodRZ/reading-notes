# Graph

## what is Graph?

**Graph** is a data structure consist of finite number of verticies (nodes) and edges (connections). *Graphs* are mostly used when there're multiple relations between verticies *ex: Social Media, Location/Mapping, Routing,..)*

## Types of Graph

there're a lot of types of graphs, the most important are:

- *weighted graph / unweighted graph*
- *directed graph / undirected graph*

a **weighted graph** is when the edge (connection) between two verticies have a weight (value).
a **directed graph** is when the edge (connection) between two verticies have a direction (a pointer from one node to another)

## Trees and Graphs

a **Tree** is a special graph that has these special properties:

- *Trees* are always **directed**
- There is a unique node called **root**(parent) node in *Trees*.
- There **will not be any cycle** in a *Tree*.
