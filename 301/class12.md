# CRUD

The **CRUD** cycle is an important part of every application, it's the meant to maintain the records in a database, or basically, it's the way to manipulate the information stored in the database.

the *CRUD* cycle principles are mapped to *REST* commands to comply with the goals of *RESTful architecture*.

## Status Codes

When working with APIs requests, the responses will always have a status code (like the famous 404), status codes indicates whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed, these status codes are grouped in five classes:

- 1XX Informational

- 2XX Success

- 3XX Redirectional

- 4XX Client Error

- 5XX Server Error

## RESTful API with NodeJs, Express, and MongoDB

Creating a RESTful routing in the back end of a dynamic web-app is achieved using many libraries and frameworks, two of the most used are **Express** framework and **Mongoose** library; *Express* is a framework used to handle HTTP requests and web application, its an important part of the *MERN development stack* (Mongo, Express, React, NodeJs).

**Mongoose** library is a *Middleware*, it's a MongoDB *ODM* (Object database Modelling) that used to translate the code and its representation from MongoDB to the Node.js server.
