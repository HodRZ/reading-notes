# Introduction to React and Components

## Component-Based Architecture

You can think of component-based architecture as deviding the code into reusable chunks, **Components**.

this helps in dividing problems into sub-problems, save time, and increase reliability by reusing existing components.
>Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

since **component** are designed to be **independent** from other dependencies, they are considered **reusable** and **replaceable**. This also helps in making the component **extensible** and can be used in different **contexts**, and be **encapsulated** without exposing any internal details.

these characteristics of **components** gives them a lot of advanteges, like being **inedepndent** provides an **ease of development, deployment, and maintenamce**, which reflects on the **relaibilty** of the system. that and **Reuseability** helps in **reducing the cost** by using third-party components.
