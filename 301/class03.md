# Passing Functions as Props

## Lists and Keys

- **Map**

In Javascript, `map()` is used to itterate over an array and transform it, and this works almost the same way in React.

`map()` is used in React to create a list of elements and include them as a bulk in *JSX*

Now, an important thing to consider, is that Reacts will throw and error that each elemnt in the list needs a **key**. Keys are a special string attribute that gives every element a unique identity, this helps React identify which element have changed, added, or removed.
